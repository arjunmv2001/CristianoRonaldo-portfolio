    <p id="#about-content1">  Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu
      ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for
      and captains both Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely
      regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3]
      and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career,
      including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the
      UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances , goals , and assists in the
      Champions League, goals in the European Championship , men's international goals , and men's
      international appearances . He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career
      appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.
  
  <br>
      Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003,
      winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
      titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or.
      Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for
      Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and
      formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning
      four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won
      back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three
      times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top
      goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's
      top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won two La Liga
      titles, two Copas del Rey, four Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups.
      In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
      expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A
      titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most
      Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and
      Italian leagues, before returning to Manchester United in 2021. He left in 2022, after his contract
      with the club was terminated. In 2023, Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr.
  
  <br>
 
      Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over
      190 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level,
      he is also the all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he
      scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He
      assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese
      player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to
      their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest
      goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also
      led them to a third-place finish at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and to victory in the inaugural
      UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the
      Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.

                <p class=>A legend of world football, Pelé, was responsible for announcing that Cristiano Ronaldo was
                    the winner of the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or at the FIFA awards ceremony in Zurich.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese is the complete footballer. The eye for goal he demonstrated time and time again last
                    year is just one of his assets on the pitch. Real Madrid and Portugal's leader, the forward has done
                    more than enough to earn one of the most prestigious individual prizes on offer from the Fedération
                    Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) making him the best player in the world.

                <p class=>Ronaldo also was notnamed on the list of nominees, failing to make thefinal shortlist. He won
                    the first FIFA Best Men's Player of the Year awards in 2016 and 2017.</p>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo lifted the 2015/16 ChampionsLeague with Real Madrid and was the tournament's top
                    goalscorer with 16 goals in 12 appearances. Beforethenewseason kicked off, the striker helped
                    hisclub wintheEuropeanSuper Cup. he also captained Portugal to their first-ever major international
                    trophy when they beat Antoine Griezmann's France to lift Euro 2016.</p>

                <p class=>Cristiano Ronaldo is second on the all time list, having won four Golden Shoes, as well as two
                    consecutively. His record is 48 goals and 96 points respectively, in 2014–15. Gerd Müller was the
                    first player to win the award twice, in 1970 and 1972. Eusébio was the first winner of the prize in
                    1968.</p>
                <p>Ronaldo becomes the fourth player to receive the trophy on four different occasions—that's one more
                    than Barcelona's Lionel Messi and two more than the likes of Eusebio, Gerd Muller and Thierry Henry.
